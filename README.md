# Stopwatch
Project for Digital Logic Design in which I have to make a stopwatch

Will use four 7-segment displays with the least significant one being incrimented every 1/100 of a second, 
the next being incremented 1/10 second, next every second, and the final incremented every 10 seconds

The stopwatch will count up to 59.99 and then reset back to 00.00

The stopwatch will have a button to pause the stopwatch
